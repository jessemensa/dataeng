FUNDAMENTALS OF DATA ENGINEERING 


WHAT IS A DATA LIFECYCLE ?? 
HOW DATA MOVES FROM ONE SOURCE TO A DESTINATION AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE DATA THROUGH 
ITS JOURNEY. 

SOME QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED BY DATA LIFECYCLE 
1. WHO WILL CONSUME THE DATA ?? WHICH DEPARTMENT IN THE BUSINESS WILL CONSUME THE DATA 
2. WHAT DATA SOURCE WILL BE USED 
3. WHERE SHOULD THE DATA BE STORED IN THE CLOUD ?? 
4. WHEN SHOULD THE DATA ARRIVE ?? 
5. WHY SHOULD THE DATA BE STORED IN THIS PLACE ? 
6. HOW SHOULD THE DATA BE PROCESSED ? 


DATAWAREHOUSE LIKE BIGQUERY ? 
THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF A DATA WAREHOUSE LIKE BIGQUERY . 
SQL INTERFACE -> SCHEMA -> COMPUTE -> STORAGE 
DATAWAREHOUSE MAIN USE ?? 
STORE AND PROCESS DATA AND USERS CAN GET THE DATA VIA SQL QUERY. 

NOW THERE IS SOMETHING ALSO CALLED A DATA LAKE ? 
SAME IDEA AS A DATAWAREHOUSE WHICH IS A CENTRALISED STORAGE BUT WITH 
DATA LAKE IT CAN STORE UNSTRUCTED DATA LIKE PHOTOS ETC 

DATA WAREHOUSE MAIN COMPOENENTS ARE 
SQL INTERFACE -> SCHEMA -> COMPUTE -> STORAGE 

DATA LAKE MAIN COMPOENENTS GO BEYOND DATA 
SQL INTERFACE -> SCHEMA -> COMPUTE -> STORAGE 
ML -> STREAM 

MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DATA WAREHOUSE AND DATA LAKE 
DATA LAKE => STORE AS MUCH DATA AS POSSIBLE 
BUSINESS RELEVANCY AND DATA MODELS ARE DEFINED LATER 

DATA WAREHOUSE => BUSINESS RELEVANCY AND DATA MODELS 
ONLY STORE DATA BASED ON BUSINESS NEEDS 

DATA LIFECYCLE 
APPS + DATABASES -> DATA LAKE -> DATA WAREHOUSE -> DATA MART -> DASHBOARD & ADHOC QUERIES 
FROM DATAMART -> BRANCH INTO MACHINE LEARNING PIPELINES 

FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS OF DATA ENGINEERING 
1. HOW TO ETL ?? 
2. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ETL & ELT 
3. WHAT IS BIG DATA ?? 
4. HOW TO HANDLE LARGE VOLUMNES OF DATA 


WHAT IS THE ETL CONCEPT IN DATA ENGINEERING 
UPSTREAM -> EXTRACT -> TRANSFORM -> LOAD -> DOWNSTREAM 

ELT ?? 
UPSTREAM -> EXTRACT -> LOAD -> DOWNSTREAM -> TRANSFORM 

ETL IS PREFERRED SINCE ETL WILL INTRODUCE ISSUES IN YOUR DOWNSTREAM PATTERN 
IE NOT ALL DOWNSTREAM SYSTEMS ARE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO HANDLE LARGE VOLUMNES OF DATA 
FOR PFP, THE ARREARS DATA SHOULD BE HANDLED USING ETL BECAUSE THE DATA IS A LOT 
AND TRANSFORMING USING DATASTREAM(POWER BI) INTRODUCES ISSUES AS HARDWARE CANNOT 
RUN THAT AMOUNT OF DATA. 

SOME CASES ELT IS MORE POWERFUL 
MOSTLY HAPPENS FOR DATA PRODUCTS LIKE HADOOP, BIGQUERY WHICH HAS POWERFUL AND CAN 
PROCESS LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA 


HOW BIG DATA TECHNOLOGIES STORE DATA 
WHAT EXACTLY IS BIGDATA ?? 
ANALYSE TWITTER DATA AND DOWNLOAD DATA AS A JSON FILE WHICH IS 5GB 
YOUR LAPTOP IS 5TB WITH 16GB MEMORY. THIS IS NOT BIGDATA 

HOWEVER TWITTER WITH 5 PETABYTES OF DATA IS BIG DATA BECAUSE YOU NEED A 
SPECIAL TO STORE IT AND A SPECIAL WAY TO PROCESS IT 

BIG DATA TECH DISTRIBUTE DATA AMONGST MULTIPLE SERVERS 
THE COMMON TERM FOR MULTIPLE SERVERS WORKING TOGETHER IS A CLUSTER. 

DISTRIBUTED FILE SYSTEMS 
WILL BREAK DOWN A LARGE FILE INTO MULTIPLE PARTS 
SPLIT THE FILE INTO IE 10 PARTS 
META DATA STORES HOW THE FILES FORM THE ORIGINAL FILE 

NOW FURTHER QUESTIONS CAN BE ASKED 
1. HOW DO I PROCESS THE FILES 
2. WHAT IF I WANT TO AGGREGATE SOME NUMBERS FROM THE FILES 
3. HOW DOES EACH PART KNOW THE RECORDS VALUE FROM OTHER PARTS WHILE STORED IN 
DIFFERENT MACHINES. 

ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION IS MAPREDUCE. 

NOW HOW DO I PROCESS MULTIPLE FILES USING MAP REDUCE 
LETS SAY TWO FILE PARTS 

PART 1 => APPLE AND BANANA 
PART 2 => MELON, APPLE AND BANANA 
PART 3 => APPLE 

CALCULATE THE WORD COUNT 
APPLE => 3 TIMES 
MELON => 1 
BANANA => 2 TIMES 

SINCE FILE PARTS ARE SEPERATED ON DIFFERENCE MACHINES 
WE CANNOT JUST COUNT THE WORDS DIRECTY 
WE USE MAPREDUCE 

MAP => ADD TO EACH INDIVIDUAL RECORD A STATIC VALUE OF 1 
THIS WILL TRANSFORM THE WORD INTO A KEY VALUE PAIR WHEN VALUE IS ALWAYS 1 

SHUFFLE => GROUP EACH WORDS AND STORE IT IN THE SAME MACHINE FOR EACH GROUP 

REDUCE => COUNT EACH FRUIT GROUP WHICH IS ALREADY IN THE SAME MACHINE 

RESULT => STORE THE FINAL RESULTS IN A SINGLE MACHINE
