QUICK OVERVIEW OF GCP SERVICES FOR DATA ENGINEERING 
SERVERLESS SERVICE OR FULLY MANAGED SERVICE 
MANAGED SERVICE => MANAGED, CONFIGURED AND MAINTAINED BY THE PROVIDER 
BEFORE THAT YOU NEED TO BUY A COMPUTER, INSTALL OS, INSTALL A SOFTWARE 
CONFIGURE THE SOFTWARE AND USE IT. 

THREE GROUPS OF MANAGED SERVICES IN GCP 
1. VM-BASED 
2. MANAGED SERVICE 
3. SERVERLESS(FULLY MANAGED SERVICES) 

VM BASED, GOOGLE MANAGED VIRTUAL MACHINES 
DONT NEED TO BUY OWN MACHINE AND OS 
BUT NEED TO INSTALL SOFTWARE YOURSELF 

MANAGED SERVICE MEANS GOOGLE MANAGES SERVICE FOR YOU 
IE USING HADOOP IN THE CLOUD 
I USED THE VM BASED APPROACH 
INSTALL HADOOP ON VMs 
best practice is to use DATAPROC WHICH IS FULLY MANAGED 
HOWEVER WE HAVE TO CONFIGURE THE MACHINE SIZE, NETWORKS AND OTHER CONFIGURATIONS 

SERVERLESS MEANS SIMPLY USE IT. 
JUST INSTALL SOFTWARE INSTANTLY 
DONT NEED TO SETUP ANYTHING TO USE THE SOFTWARE 
IE BIGQUERY 


SCENARIOS 
VM BASED APPROACH 
1. PROVISION MULTIPLE VM INSTANCES IN GCP USING COMPUTE ENGINE. 
THEN CONFIGURE VM NETWORKS, OS PACKAGES AND ANY INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS 

OBSERVATIONS 
What is the drawback? Flexibility. In vm based approach, you can install any software and its version as you 
like, you have full control of your infrastructure, but you need to take care of its scalability, 
availability, logging, and other management stuff yourself.

2. INSTALL HADOOP CLUSTER ON TOP OF COMPUTE ENGINE INSTANCES 

3. STORE DATA IN HDFS AND CREATE A HIVE TABLE ON TOP OF HADOOP CLUSTER 

MANAGED SERVICE 
1. PROVISION A HADOOP MANAGED SERVICE CLUSTER(DATAPROC) 
2. STORE DATA IN HDFS AND CREATE A HIVE TABLE ON TOP OF HADOOP CLUSTER 

managed service 
Dataproc, you don't need to create each VM instance manually; Google will set the underlying Hadoop 
infrastructure for you, but you need to choose the version that is available.

FULLY MANAGED SERVICE 
1. STORE DATA IN BIGQUERY TABLE, WHICH IS FULLY MANAGED SERVICE FOR DATAWAREHOUSE

USER ACCOUNT VS SERVICE ACCOUNTS 
USER ACCOUNT => PERSONAL ACCOUNT AS A HUMAN USER 
SERVICE ACCOUNT => AS ACCOUNT WILL BE USED BY NON HUMANS 
SERVICE ACCOUNTS USED TO BY MACHINES TO DO TASKS 
IE TRIGGER JOBS, BUILD DOCKER IMAGES, RUN PYTHON SCRIPTS
